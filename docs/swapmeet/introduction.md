# Introduction

SwapMeet is a cross-platform desktop application that allows you to create a *network* of android devices and share them with other users on the network.
Internally, SwapMeet uses the [AdbOrc](https://github.com/mobi-nex/adborc.git) library to create and manage the device network, and hence all the concepts
and terminologies used in SwapMeet are the same as those used in *AdbOrc*. Please refer to the [AdbOrc documentation](/adborc/introduction) for more details.
SwapMeet provides an intuitive UI for interacting with AdbOrc and makes it easier to configure and manage the device network with minimal effort.
